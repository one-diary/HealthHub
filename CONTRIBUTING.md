Submitting a pull request
Fork and clone the repository.
Configure and install the dependencies: npm install.
Make sure the tests and linters pass on your machine: npm test && npm run lint
Create a new branch: git checkout -b my-branch-name.
Make your change, add tests, and make sure the tests still pass.
Push to your fork and submit a pull request.
Pat your self on the back and wait for your pull request to be reviewed and merged.
Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

Write and update tests.
Keep your changes as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
Write a good commit message.
Work in Progress pull requests are also welcome to get feedback early on, or if there is something blocked you.

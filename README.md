Making healthy lifestyle changes is easier said than done. Even when we're strongly motivated, adopting a new, healthy habit â€” or breaking an old, bad one â€” can be terribly difficult. Creating and maintaining healthy eating habits doesnâ€™t have to be hard. If you start by incorporating small changes into your daily habits, you can make a big impact on your eating pattern and create lasting, healthy eating habits. HealthHub wants to help you do just that!

## How is this tool helpful?

- Goals: Your first step towards a healthy lifestyle is setting two goals. The first goal is your target number. Once you've set this goal, next is to figure out your deadline. Be realistic about them.
- Exercise Plan: Exercise at a local gym, go for a jog or try those workout videos at home! However you choose to exercise, a great way to help you stay focused on your goal is to use a fitness tracker.
- Eating Right: In addition to your new exercise routine, you will also be changing your diet. But don't think of it as dieting, you will simply be forming new and healthier eating habits.
